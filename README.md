#Conference Planner

This conference planning software (sometimes referred to as "event management software") is used by event planning professionals to help them plan events such as conferences, conventions and other large gatherings. It helps plan things like venues, lists of attendees and participants. It also assists in building the complete event schedule and points out potential scheduling and/or room conflicts while you're building it. The Conference Planner tool also allows sending emails to prospective speakers and attendees, and lets you build surveys to assist in collecting data before, during or after your event.

This open-source Conference Planner core code is a core component of an event management software tool by Grenadine Technologies called the <a href="https://events.grenadine.co/">Grenadine Event Planner</a>.
